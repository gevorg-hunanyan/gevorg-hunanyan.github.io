I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Mathematics at Yerevan State University, after completing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. As a Junior Researcher in Cryptography at the Institute for Informatics and Automation Problems of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia (IIAP NAS RA), I explore topics in symmetric cryptography. Additionally, I serve as a Teaching Associate at the American University of Armenia, where I teach Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory.

This website contains information about me, the projects I've done, and a blog about things I found interesting.
